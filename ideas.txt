- Spotify API
    - Tracks have an "Audio Analysis" endpoint
        - Could we take the Crossroads song catalog and compare the Audio Analysis against the Audio Analysis of the "Top 100 Christian Songs" playlist
            - Trying to understand how the style compares against what is working currently
- Need to know what data we currently have. Has Ryan done anything with warehousing of the streaming data?

- I'm curious about the impact of the songs "Audio Features" vs. popularity
    - Is there correlation between any of those and popularity
    - Maybe do PCA on the audio features?
